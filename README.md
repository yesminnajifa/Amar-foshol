# 🌾 Amar Fosol – Agriculture Assistance System

**Amar Fosol** is a web-based agriculture assistance platform designed to support farmers with essential digital tools such as plant disease simulation, a rule-based chatbot, market price dashboard, expert video consultation, and a demo payment system.
This project was developed as part of the **CSE415 (Web Engineering & Lab)** course.

## 🚀 Features

### 🌿 Plant Disease Detection (Simulated)

Upload leaf images and receive a simulated result.
*(No real ML model integrated yet — prepared for future AI integration.)*

### 💬 Farmer Chatbot

A rule-based chatbot that answers common agricultural questions using keyword matching.

### 📈 Market Price Dashboard

Displays crop prices using static datasets.
Designed to support real-time API integration in future versions.

### 🎥 Expert Video Consultation

Integrated **Jitsi Meet API** for browser-based live expert sessions.

### 💳 Demo Payment System

A simple test interface for future payment gateway integration.

### 📩 Authentication & Forms

Includes contact forms, newsletter signup, and login/signup pages using PHP.

## 🎯 Project Goals

The project aims to bridge the gap between farmers and digital agricultural services by providing a unified, easy-to-use platform. It focuses on modular design, scalability, and the potential to integrate real machine learning models, dynamic data, and secure backend systems in the future.

---

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

* Plant disease detection uses dummy logic
* Market data is static
* No database integration
* Features not tested with real farmers
* Requires stable internet for video calls
* Many modules are proof-of-concept only

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Real AI/ML model for disease detection
* Live price data from government/API sources
* Database integration for authentication & user history
* Offline mode and improved usability for rural areas
* Real-world farmer testing and feedback
* Mobile app version
